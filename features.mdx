## Document Organization and Folders

Create a clear hierarchy to manage your documentation. You start by setting up top-level folders for major categories like "API Reference" or "User Guides". Nest subfolders for deeper organization, such as "API Reference > Endpoints > Users".

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your project dashboard.
    
    Click the `New Folder` button in the sidebar.
    
````bash
# Example folder structure you'll see
docs/
├── api/
│   └── endpoints/
├── guides/
│   └── onboarding/
└── changelog.mdx
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Move Documents" icon="move">
    Drag and drop files between folders.
    
    Use the `Move to` option in the document menu for bulk actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rename and Delete" icon="edit-3">
    Right-click folders to rename or archive them safely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions like `kebab-case` for folders to improve searchability.
</Callout>

## Project Collaboration Tools

Invite teammates to collaborate in real-time. Assign roles such as Viewer, Editor, or Admin to control access. Share specific folders or documents via public links with expiration dates.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Invite Users" icon="user-plus">
    From the project settings, enter email addresses.
    
    ```javascript
    // Example invite API call (if using George's API)
    await fetch('https://api.example.com/projects/123/invites', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        emails: ['team@company.com'],
        role: 'editor'
      })
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Share Links" icon="share-2">
    Generate shareable links with permissions.
    
    Set viewer limits or passwords for sensitive docs.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Real-time Edits" icon="edit">
    Multiple users edit simultaneously with live cursors and change notifications.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search and Filtering Options

Locate any document instantly with George's full-text search. Filter by folder, tag, author, or last modified date. Advanced options include boolean searches like `API AND authentication`.

| Filter Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Keyword | Matches titles and content | `oauth flow` |
| Folder | Scope to specific paths | `in:api/endpoints` |
| Tags | Filter by custom labels | `tag:security` |
| Date | Recent changes | `modified:>2024-01-01` |

<Callout kind="info">
  Pro tip: Use quotes for exact phrases, e.g., `"user authentication"`.
</Callout>

## Version Control for Docs

George tracks every change automatically, allowing you to view diffs, restore previous versions, or compare branches. This integrates with Git for advanced users.

<CodeGroup tabs="Markdown,Diff">
  ```markdown
  # Before Edit
  ## Authentication
  
  Use `{API_KEY}` for basic auth.
  ```
  ```diff
  # Version Diff View
  ## Authentication
  + Use `{API_KEY}` for basic auth.
  - Use basic auth only.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

    A[Edit Doc] --> B[Auto Save]
    B --> C[New Version]
    C --> D[View History]
    D --> E[Restore or Compare]
```

<Expandable title="Advanced Git Integration" default-open="false">
